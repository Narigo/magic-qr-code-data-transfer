# Magic QR Code Data Transfer

Ever wondered how to get some data from a computer to your phone without bluetooth and don't want to share it through some server/service on the internet?

You can use your phone's camera to do that!

This web-app lets you create QR codes for longer texts that you can then scan from another device and retrieve its information again.

It will not send any data to the server, the app only manages the creation of QR codes by splitting it into chunks. The same app can be used to retrieve these QR codes and put the information back together. As soon as you have opened the web-page, it will work without using the internet.

Workflow:
1. Go to the Magic QR Code Data Transfer page on the device where you want to send something (the sender). 👩‍💻
2. Input all the text you want to send to the receiving device. ⌨️
3. Go to the Magic QR Code Data Transfer page on the device that you want to get the data to (the receiver). 👨‍💻
4. Scan all the images of the QR codes. 📷
5. Copy the data to your clipboard 😎

There are a couple of issues in the [Project board](https://github.com/Narigo/magic-qr-code-data-transfer/projects/1) that need some attention. It would be nice to work on this.
